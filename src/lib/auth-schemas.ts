// This file is no longer strictly necessary for the simplified form handling
// as Zod validation is not being used directly in the login/signup forms.
// However, it's kept in case Zod is used for other schema definitions or if
// you decide to re-introduce form validation with Zod later.
// For the "very basic" login/signup, we've removed its direct usage.

// import { z } from "zod";

// export const loginSchema = z.object({
//   email: z.string().email({ message: "Invalid email address." }),
//   password: z.string().min(6, { message: "Password must be at least 6 characters." }),
// });

// export const signupSchema = z.object({
//   email: z.string().email({ message: "Invalid email address." }),
//   password: z.string().min(6, { message: "Password must be at least 6 characters." }),
//   confirmPassword: z.string().min(6, { message: "Password must be at least 6 characters." }),
// }).refine((data) => data.password === data.confirmPassword, {
//   message: "Passwords don't match.",
//   path: ["confirmPassword"], // path of error
// });

// If you have no other uses for Zod for these specific schemas, you can delete this file.
// For now, I'm leaving it empty to signify it's not actively used by the forms.
// (Or you could delete it and update any other imports if they exist)

export {}; // Ensures the file is treated as a module if it's empty
